                Emma Poe spends her time making music when sheâ€™s not busy working her part time job. 
                She dreams of being a touring artist but for now sheâ€™s just trying to get gigs in her hometown. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Emma produces and distributes her own music through popular platforms like CDBaby. 
                Sheâ€™s noticed her music is missing something but doesnâ€™t know exactly what.
